# RuuviTag Parser

This repository is heavily inspired by [pakastin/node-ruuvitag](https://github.com/pakastin/node-ruuvitag),
which I also took as a base and did some heavy refactoring, as well as converting the old JavaScript files
into TypeScript.

**!! This repository is still a work in progress !!**

This module only handles the parsing. This module wont scan the sensors or any other shenanigans.
