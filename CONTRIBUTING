This repository is being developed in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/kirbo/ruuvitag-parser).
CI/CD Pipeline can be [found here](https://gitlab.com/kirbo/ruuvitag-parser/-/pipelines).

CI/CD Pipeline uses [go-semantic-release](https://github.com/go-semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated
releases. Because of this, developers should follow [these instructions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples)
for commit message formatting.

The commits are being analyzed with [this extension](https://github.com/go-semantic-release/commit-analyzer-cz#how-the-commit-messages-are-analyzed)
and it requires developers to format commit messages in certain way.
